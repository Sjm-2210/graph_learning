Here , we talk about Machine Learning with Graphs. 
First we discuss a few basic statistical and probabilistic methods to help us understand the concepts of Graph Learning. 
Then we learn about Feature engineering, some basic properties of Graph
Slowly we move towards understanding the node2vec algorithm by Jure Lekstovec and Aditya Grover and also draw ana analogy from NLP'S word2vec algorithm.
